# Creative Programming Winter Semester 
Code and Examples for my lecture ›Creative Programming‹ at the University of Art and Design Linz.

The winter semester provides an introduction to basic programming procedures. P5 was chosen as the programming language for this introductionas it is rather accessible and JavaScript has gained relevance in recent years. 
The topic of the course is "Gaming". By creating simple arcade games, interaction, handling graphics and logic will be taught.

   - Arrays
3. Avatars and Enemies
   - Collision detection
